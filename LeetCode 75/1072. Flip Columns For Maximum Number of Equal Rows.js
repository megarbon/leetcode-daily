/*
You are given an m x n binary matrix matrix.

You can choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column (i.e., Change the value of the cell from 0 to 1 or vice versa).

Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.


Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: After flipping no values, 1 row has all values equal.
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first column, both rows have equal values.
Example 3:

Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first two columns, the last two rows have equal values.
 

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
